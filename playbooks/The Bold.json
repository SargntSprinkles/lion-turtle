You can understand and communicate with your small companion and--although they may give you a hard time now and again--they are always there when you need them most. Whenever your pal could help you push your luck, mark fatigue to roll with <strong>Creativity</strong> instead of <strong>Passion</strong>. If your pet ever gets hurt, mark a condition."

On a 7-9, hold 1. You can spend your hold 1-for-1 while the plan is being carried out to overcome or evade an obstacle, create an advantage, or neutralize a danger; if any of your companions abandon you while the plan is underway, you must mark a condition. On a miss, hold 1, but your plan goes awry when you encounter surpris- ing opposition."

On a hit, the GM tells you how you can drastically improve the chances of success; get it done, and they're sure to come through on top. On a 7-9, the problems inherent in the plan are fairly serious; the NPC will be resistant to making the necessary changes. On a miss, something about the plan throws you for a loop; the GM tells you what obvious danger the NPC is ignoring...or what they're hiding about their intent."

On a hit, they'll look upon your honesty favorably; they'll answer a non-compromising question honestly and grant you a simple favor. On a 7-9, they also give you an honest assessment of how they see you; mark a condition. On a miss, you're a bit too honest—they're either furious or genuinely hurt."
