If you do choose to shift your lodestar, clear a condition.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>shut down someone vulnerable to harsh words or icy silence</strong>, shift your balance toward Results and roll with Results. On a hit, they mark a condition and you may clear the same condition. On a 10+, they also cannot shift your balance or <strong>call you out</strong> for the rest of the scene. On a miss, they have exactly the right retort; mark a condition and they shift your balance. You cannot use this on your lodestar.</p>\n<p>When your lodestar <strong>shifts your balance</strong> or <strong>calls you out</strong>, you cannot resist it. Treat an NPC lodestar calling you out as if you rolled a 10+, and a PC lodestar calling you out as if they rolled a 10+.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>consult your lodestar for advice on a problem</strong> (or permission to use your preferred solution), roll with Restraint. On a 10+ take all three; on a 7-9 they choose two:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You see the wisdom of their advice. They shift your balance; follow their advice and they shift your balance again.</li>\n<li>The conversation bolsters you. Clear a condition or 2-fatigue.</li>\n<li>They feel at ease offering their opinion. They clear a condition or 2-fatigue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a miss, something about their advice infuriates you. Mark a condition or have the GM shift your balance twice.</p>"
